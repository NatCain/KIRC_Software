LOG:
*2/1/2014: Last night, the first composite instance of this software was integrated.
		   The goal over the next several days is to clean up the software and add
		   more modules to it.	

*2/3/2014: Attempting more cleanup, removing unnessecary code

*2/5/2014: Added support for 4 PWM outputs
		   Attempted to add support for channel reading, but CLOCK input reading flooded interrupt channel	

*2/7/2014: Added support for 4 channel PWM input reading, fixed the CLOCK issue.
		   
*2/12/2014: Added Roll, Pitch motor control. Still need PID support.

*2/14/2014: Cleaned up code, got rid of the logging functions, as they are not necessary for the final project

*2/21/2014: Added PWM support, and got controller feedback working. Still needs work, yaw doesn't translate for each axis.
			PID needs to be tuned, and code needs to be finalized

*2/26/2014: Changed around the sensor reading framework, now done with global variables (don't complain Wade)
			The code now uses full coordinate transformation to euler rather than the approximation
			that didn't take yaw into account. When compiling the code and flashing it onto the device, the 
			start/resume button doesn't appear as an option, but if you reset the device (using the reset button),
			it still works. Not sure why. 

*3/1/2014: Added safety functions (Timeout, and Killswitch). Restructured code again, made the read input function more efficient.
		   Started doing stability testing for the quadcopter, some success, still needs work.
		   Output to motors drifts slowly over time.
		   
*3/3/2014: Restructured code, fixed motor output drift (from integral windup and sensor error). PID testing went well, still needs work.

*3/5/2014: Optimized PID code, and cleanup

*3/10-15/2014: PID testing, and optimization, finally got semi stable flight.

*3/17/2014: Fixed certain yaw derivative issue (hopefully this fixes the out of control yaw issue). Added better state machine design,
			now when the quad is initializing, the motors cannot be armed.
